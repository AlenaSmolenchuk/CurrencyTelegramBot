# CurrencyTelegramBot
I have written a telegram bot whose task is to present the current exchange rate of the selected currency.
The data is parsed from the site: http://www.finmarket.ru
The essence of the bot's work is that when you enter the / start command, the bot offers to select any currency represented as buttons with currency codes, after which it displays the current ratio of the selected currency to the Russian ruble at a given time.
